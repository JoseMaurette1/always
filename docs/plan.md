# Always - Software Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

Migration from LocalStorage to Supabase Database for the Always workout app.

## Task Tracking Status

- [x] Configure environment variables (.env.local created with URL and ANON_KEY)
- [x] Set up Supabase client in the application (lib/supabase.ts created)
- [x] Configure authentication settings (Anonymous auth configured in lib/auth.ts)

### Development Environment

- [x] Update project dependencies (@supabase/supabase-js and @tanstack/react-query installed)
- [x] Set up TypeScript types for Supabase (Database interface created in lib/supabase.ts)
- [x] Configure development environment variables
- [ ] Set up testing environment

## 2. Database Schema Design

### Core Tables

- [x] Users table
  - User profile information (Using Supabase Auth)
  - Authentication details
- [x] Workouts table
  - Workout name
  - Date
  - User reference (Changed from UUID to TEXT to support temporary IDs)
  - Added workout_type field
  - Added metadata JSON field
- [x] Exercises table
  - Exercise name
  - Updated sets to JSONB array
  - Added rest_timer_duration
  - Added metadata JSON field
  - Workout reference

### Database Relations

- [x] Define foreign key relationships (exercises.workout_id references workouts.id)
- [x] Set up cascading deletes (ON DELETE CASCADE added)
- [ ] Configure indexes for performance
- [x] Implement row level security policies (Updated to work with temporary user IDs)

## 3. Authentication Implementation

- [-] Set up Supabase Auth (Using temporary user IDs instead of anonymous auth)
- [-] Implement sign up functionality (Optional - using local IDs for now)
- [-] Implement sign in functionality (Optional - using local IDs for now)
- [ ] Add password reset flow
- [ ] Create protected routes
- [x] Implement session management (Using safeLocalStorage for consistent temporary IDs)

## 4. API Layer Implementation

### Backend (Supabase)

- [x] Create database access functions (lib/api.ts created with CRUD functions)
- [x] Set up row level security
- [ ] Configure CORS policies
- [ ] Create database triggers if needed

### Frontend Integration

- [x] Create API utility functions (saveWorkoutToSupabase, getWorkoutHistory, clearWorkoutHistory)
- [-] Implement data fetching with TanStack Query (Using basic async/await for now)
- [x] Set up error handling (Added try/catch blocks with toast notifications)
- [x] Add loading states (Added loading indicators to WorkoutHistory)
- [ ] Implement offline functionality
- [ ] Add retry mechanisms

## 5. Data Migration Strategy

### Planning

- [x] Design migration script (Using hybrid approach with localStorage + Supabase)
- [ ] Create backup strategy
- [ ] Define rollback plan
- [ ] Document migration process

### Implementation

- [x] Create data export function from localStorage (Integrated in WorkoutHistory component)
- [x] Implement data transformation logic (JSON to database structure)
- [x] Create data import function to Supabase (Via API functions)
- [x] Add validation checks (Basic error handling)
- [-] Create migration progress indicator (Using loading states)

## 6. Frontend Updates

### UI Components

- [x] Update forms for new data structure (SaveWorkoutButton now saves to Supabase)
- [x] Add loading states (Added to WorkoutHistory and SaveWorkoutButton)
- [x] Implement error messages (Added toast notifications)
- [x] Create success notifications (Added toast confirmations)
- [x] Update data display components (WorkoutHistory now displays merged data)

### State Management

- [-] Implement TanStack Query hooks (Partially implemented, needs refinement)
- [-] Update global state management (Basic state managed per component)
- [ ] Add offline state handling
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates

## 7. Testing

### Unit Tests

- [ ] Test API utility functions
- [ ] Test data transformation functions
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Test form validations

### Integration Tests

- [ ] Test data migration process
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Test CRUD operations
- [ ] Test offline functionality

### E2E Tests
